The default resolution for v4l2loopback-dc is 640x480. You can override the
value by copying droidcam.conf.default to /etc/modprobe.d/droidcam.conf 
and modifying the 'width' and 'height' parameters.

See https://github.com/aramg/droidcam/issues/56 on why a fork of v4l2loopback
is currently being used here.
